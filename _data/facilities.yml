    title: DESY
    descr: "DESY is one of the world’s leading accelerator centres. Researchers use the large-scale facilities at DESY to explore the microcosm in all its variety – from the interactions of tiny elementary particles and the behaviour of new types of nanomaterials to biomolecular processes that are essential to life. The accelerators and detectors that DESY develops and builds are unique research tools. The facilities generate the world’s most intense X-ray light, accelerate particles to record energies and open completely new windows onto the universe."

    title: MPSD and CFEL
    descr: "The Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter currently hosts three independent Max Planck Research Groups focused on Structure and Dynamics of Cold and Controlled Molecules, Quantum Optics with X-Rays and Dynamics of Nanoelectronic Systems. Participants will be given talks from key researchers of the Institute as well as a Lab Tour. DESY, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, and the University of Hamburg established together a Centre for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL) on the Hamburg University site. CFEL focuses on developing and exploiting the scientific applications of the new radiation sources with outstanding properties."
