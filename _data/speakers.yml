  bio: Laureato in Fisica nel 1999 presso l’Università degli Studi di Pavia con un lavoro di tesi di strumentazione nell’ambito dell’esperimento ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS). Nel 2003 consegue il Dottorato di Ricerca in Fisica, sempre presso l’Università degli Studi di Pavia, con curriculum di Fisica Nucleare e Subnucleare, durante il quale si è occupato del controllo di qualità delle camere MDT dello spettrometro muonico di ATLAS. Parallelamente all’attività di laboratorio ha contribuito allo studio della fenomenologia di modelli con dimensioni spaziali supplementari. Dal 2003 al 2005 Assegnista di Ricerca INFN nell’ambito dell’esperimento ICARUS (Imaging Cosmic And Rare Underground Signals) in cui segue la fase di caratterizzazione del rivelatore TPC, la risposta dei fotomoltiplicatori in ambiente criogenico e la preparazione per l’installazione presso i Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Nel 2006 entra nello staff del LENA (Laboratorio Energia Nucleare Applicata) come Operatore del Ciclotrone. Nel 2009 consegue la patente di Operatore del reattore nucleare di ricerca TRIGA Mk II. Nel 2013 consegue la patente di Supervisore e nel 2014 l’Attestato alla Direzione Tecnica di Impianti Nucleari di Ricerca tipo TRIGA Mk II.	Attualmente ricopre l’incarico di Direttore Tecnico di Impianto e Responsabile del Servizio di Fisica Sanitaria del LENA.
